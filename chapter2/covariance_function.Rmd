First of all, read csv file. the file is not attached on this git, but exists on local environment. 
```{r}
cins <- read.csv("rchk_cins.csv", header=FALSE)
```
A Preprocessing is necessary for this data to analyze stationary process. This data from the interner follows poisson distribution, so we use logarithm.
```{r}
log_cins <- log(cins[2])
```
After the normalization, do time-series analysis. R provides ts function. How to use this function is quite simple: add list as a paramter.
```{r}
w <- ts(log_cins)
```
Finally draw and calculate time-series covariance.
```{r}
plot(w)
acf(w)
```
From this the acf, this function has 7 days of constant period.
